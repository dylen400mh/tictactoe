# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to demonstrate skills in organizing code using modules and factories, manipulating the DOM, implementing game logic, and creating an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm.

## Project Overview
The project consists of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can place their marks on a game board by clicking on empty spots. The game checks for win conditions (3-in-a-row) or a tie and displays a congratulatory message for the winning player. The code is organized into modules and factories to minimize the use of global code. Additionally, an AI opponent can be implemented using the minimax algorithm.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Organizing code using modules and factories
- Manipulating the DOM to update the UI
- Implementing game logic for win conditions and tie detection
- Handling user input and interactions
- Creating an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm
